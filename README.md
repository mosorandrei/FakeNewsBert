# FakeNewsBert
Project done for the 'Programming Engineering' course from the 2nd Year. Using BERT, our task was create a model which classifies a certain text as being 'false', 'partially false', 'true' or 'other'. Our team (the BERT Team) participated in the CLEF2021-CheckThat! competition, along with three other teams.
